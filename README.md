🛒 E-Commerce Customer Behavior Analysis (Python)

Raw e-commerce data rarely tells a story on its own.
Orders, customers, prices, and categories only become useful when we ask the right questions.

This project focuses on understanding how customers behave, what drives purchases, and how sales patterns evolve over time using Python-based analysis.

🧠 Problem Framing

Instead of starting with charts, this project starts with business curiosity:
Who are the most valuable customers?
How frequently do customers return to make purchases?
Which products and categories actually drive revenue?
Are sales driven by many small buyers or a few high-value ones?
Python is used as the primary tool to explore these questions systematically.

🔍 How the Analysis Was Approached

The analysis follows a thinking-first process:
Clean and prepare raw transactional data
Explore customer-level behavior instead of only order totals
Break down revenue by category, customer type, and purchase frequency
Identify repeat buying patterns and high-impact segments
The focus is not just what happened, but why it happened.

📊 Insights That Emerged

Some of the key patterns observed during analysis:
A small percentage of customers contribute a large share of total revenue
Repeat customers show noticeably higher average order values
Certain product categories consistently outperform others
Purchase behavior varies significantly across customer segments
These insights mirror real-world e-commerce dynamics seen in production environments.

🧩 Analytical Techniques Used

Rather than listing tools, this project demonstrates the ability to:
Work with structured transactional datasets
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns
Segment customers based on behavior
Translate numerical findings into business-relevant insights
All analysis is performed using Python, focusing on clarity and reasoning.

🎯 Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates:
Analytical thinking beyond surface-level metrics
Comfort working with real-world, messy data
Ability to connect customer behavior with business outcomes

A strong foundation for roles involving Data Analysis, Business Analytics, or Product Analytics
